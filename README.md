# hello-muso

Hello Muso is your chance to show us how you write, reason and commit code.

# Overview

This is a coding assignment. We want to see how you approach building a full stack, hello world style application, in the shortest possible time.

We will be focusing on:

* Simplicity
* Best practices
* Elegance
* Contemporary Code

# Requirements

This coding assignment is more like a puzzle than a project. Approach it the wrong way, it's going to seem daunting and insurmountable, approach it the right way, it's going to be a piece of cake. 

1. Structure your project as a monolithic microservice repo
2. Make sure it can be cloned and run locally by us
3. Make sure this runs on a machine with ONLY docker and chrome installed

# Tasks

While working on your tasks, please commit and push your code, including WIPs. We want to see your rich interior coding-life, not just one hairball at the end. 

Each task is just a prompt, at the end of the project, as long as you meet the acceptance critera, what order you approach the project is up to you.

## P-Zeros

1. New Project: A VSCode project, laid out as a monolithic microservice repo
2. Backend: A MongoDB database
3. API: An Express.js based API
4. Front end: An Angular based SPA
5. GET: A list of songs are read from the database via the API and rendered by the front end app
6. POST: A new song can be created in the database via the API using a form rendered by the front end app
7. PUT: An existing song can be updated in the database via the API using a form rendered by the front end app
8. DELETE: An existing song can be removed from the database via the API using a form rendered by the front end app

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clone your repo
2. Run your project
3. All sub-systems start without erroring
4. Front end is loadable via a browser
5. We are able to list, add, edit and remove songs from the database

# Getting Started

Just clone this repo into your own workspace. When you're ready to submit, just send us a PR

# FAQ

1. **Is there a time limit?** No, there isn't, but this should be able to be completed in around 8 dev hours
2. **Can I use other technologies if I don't like MongoDB, Express or Angular?** No
3. **Do I have to deploy this to the cloud?** No, but if you do, you'll definitely get extra credit
4. **What async approach should I take?** We'll leave that up to you, but we are looking for contemporary skills, so if you use callbacks, we're going to have to report you
5. **What happens if I have a problem or find a bug in the instructions?** Please cut an issue against this repo, we're monitoring the issue log and will answer it asap
